A brief description of this todo list belongs to what project

## Tasks

- #### MUST to DO (List the works that proper working of project depends on these tasks):
    - Increase the thickness to minimum 5 mm. edges can be done with 2mm chamfer.
    - Make the edges dented so it can be curvy like (https://youtu.be/ujAwxSx63FE).
    - Checking with solid edge 3d printer functionality
    - The general rule of printing slopes (overhangs) is that they shouldn't exceed 45-degrees. The idea behind this is to ensure each successive layer has enough support to build up on. At 45 degrees, every layer is in about 50% contact with the layer below it and hence prints well.
